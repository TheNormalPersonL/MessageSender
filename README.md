# MessageSender
A simple Discord Message sender made purely for sending messages by a bot from the terminal with Discord.js v14 and Inquirer.

## ! Warning !
Please make sure you do not share the code without taking your bot token out of the code, since it will be dangerous for your account (doesn't matter if it's a bot, it's still technically your bot, so you will be punished for any rule being broken).

## How to use?
1 - Download [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
2 - Run "npm install discord.js inquirer@8"
3 - Run "node index.js"
4 - Select the channel you'd like to send a message to (VCs also work)
5 - Type whatever you want to send in the channel, and press enter

## Current commands
clearconsole - Clears the console if it looks too clogged
goback - Goes back to the channel selection screen
